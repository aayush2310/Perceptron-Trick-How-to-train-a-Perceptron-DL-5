How do we train the weights and biases of a perceptron
In linear regression we use the line y=mx+c whereas in logistic regression we use the standard form of the line Ax+By+C=0
I need to find the A,B and C which can classify a region into two parts.
Perceptron Trick:-
We start with the random values of A,B and C i.e a random line.Perceptron trick says that you need to run a loop(say 1000 times/epochs),each time in the loop you select 
a random student and ask whether it is on the correct side of not.If the point is on the correct side,then you will not change anything.If any point is classified wrong,
then you will perform a transformation in A,B and C in such a way that ,that point is classified correctly.
